/*
	"Georgetown Invasion" static mission for Tanoa.
	Created by [CiC]red_ned using templates by eraser1
	easy/mod/difficult/hardcore - reworked by [CiC]red_ned http://cic-gaming.co.uk
*/

How it works, and how to change things.
Out of the box the mission should be fairly similar to original none difficulty mission versions with same install instructions.

Note - I have tried to keep much of the new code in the sections where it was originally to make it easier to read and adjust, this isnt always the most convenient/quickest/smallest route but considering the amount of configuration that can be done i thought it would be easiest and simplest way.

**************************************************************************************************************************************************	
>>>> This section describes the variables used inside the mission ** Don't change this line unless you know what you're doing!** and yes i had to add some original values due to now using them as full local variables.

>>>> What they all do later in the mission file

"_AICount",						// Defines starting AI count - you can change to make initial AI numbers different per mission difficulty
"_AIdelay",						// Defines the amount of time between sensing if the AI numbers have fallen below the trigger number set in _AIwave, you can speed up missions or slow them down with this
"_AIMaxReinforcements",			// Defines how many AI reinforcements are available to the mission - you can change per mission difficulty to lower or raise the amount of AI overall
"_AItrigger",					// Defines how many AI trigger reinforcements - you can change per mission difficulty to lower or raise the amount of AI before reinforcements arrive
"_AIwave",						// Defines maximum amount of AI which may be deployed at once in reinforcement trigger
"_staticguns",					// Defines position of any static guns - used in a detect of "easy" mission to reduce amount of guns
"_missionObjs",					// Defines what things are being spawned as part of mission and what to clean up at the end **Don't Change**
"_crate0",						// Defines 1st crate position **Don't Change**
"_crate1",						// Defines 2nd crate position **Don't Change**
"_crate_loot_values0",			// Defines collection of weapons, items, backpacks in 1st crate **Don't Change**
"_crate_loot_values1",			// Defines collection of weapons, items, backpacks in 2nd crate **Don't Change**
"_crate_weapons0",				// Defines amount of weapons in 1st crate - you can change to adjust loot for each mission diffficulty
"_crate_weapons1",				// Defines amount of weapons in 2nd crate - you can change to adjust loot for each mission diffficulty
"_crate_items0",				// Defines amount of items in 1st crate - you can change to adjust loot for each mission diffficulty

"_crate_backpacks0",			// Defines amount of backpacks in 1st crate - you can change to adjust loot for each mission diffficulty
"_crate_backpacks1",			// Defines amount of backpacks in 2nd crate - you can change to adjust loot for each mission diffficulty
"_difficultyM",					// Defines mission difficulty result (also used for the mission marker) **Don't Change**
"_difficulty",					// Defines AI difficulty in easy mission diffficulty setting - an "easy" mission can have "hardcore" AI
"_PossibleDifficulty",			// Defines list of possible mission difficulties (isnt linked to how diffficult the AI is) - you can add more to change % chance
"_msgWIN",						// Defines mission win message - you can change to make mission win message different **Remeber there are a few versions including the pin code announce**
"_cash0",						// Defines Tabs for crate0
"_cash1",						// Defines Tabs for crate1


"_spawnPos",					// Defines heli spawn position
"_dropPoint",					// Defines heli reinforcement drop point
"_heliClass",					// Define AI heli type


"_AISniperSpawnLocations",		// Defines all possible sniper locations
"_AICountSnipers",				// Defines possible number of snipers
"_AIPatrolSpawnLocations",		// Defines all possible vehicle locations

"_group"						// Controls the 1st group of foot AI plus the ground vehicle patrols
"_group2"						// Controls the 2nd group of foot AI who are snipers on roofs
"_group3"						// Controls the heli reinforcements

this is basically set to reinforce the vehicles up to 5 times and the normal non-sniper AI as per the numbers in config

>>>> thats basically the whole set up which should give flexibility on % chance of mission from the main DMS config, % chance of a difficulty from _PossibleDifficulty and then all the individual settings along the way giving some random parameters for each difficulty level.

Enjoy..
