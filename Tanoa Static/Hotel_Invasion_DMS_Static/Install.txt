4.	Add to end

// Add the "hotel_invasion" mission to the existing mission types.
DMS_StaticMissionTypes append

										];

	DMS_BasesToImportOnServerStart = 	[							// List of static bases to import on server startup (spawned post-init). This will reduce the amount of work the server has to do when it actually spawns static missions, and players won't be surprised when a base suddenly pops up. You can also include any other M3E-exported bases to spawn here.
											//"saltflatsbase",		//<--Example (already imported by default on Altis)
