	"Lubjansk" v2.1 static mission for Namalsk.

How it works, and how to change things.
Out of the box the mission should be fairly similar to original none difficulty mission versions with same install instructions.

Note - I have tried to keep much of the new code in the sections where it was originally to make it easier to read and adjust, this isnt always the most convenient/quickest/smallest route but considering the amount of configuration that can be done i thought it would be easiest and simplest way.

**************************************************************************************************************************************************	
>>>> This section describes the variables used inside the mission ** Don't change this line unless you know what you're doing!** and yes i had to add some original values due to now using them as full local variables.

private ["_AICount", "_AIMaxReinforcements", "_AItrigger", "_AIwave", "_AIdelay", "_staticguns", "_missionObjs", "_crate0", "_crate1", "_crate_loot_values0", "_crate_loot_values1", "_crate_weapons0", "_crate_weapons1", "_crate_items0", "_crate_items1", "_crate_backpacks0", "_crate_backpacks1", "_difficultyM", "_difficulty", "_PossibleDifficulty", "_msgWIN"];

>>>> What they all do later in the mission file

"_AICount",						// Defines starting AI count - you can change to make initial AI numbers different per mission difficulty
"_AIdelay",						// Defines the amount of time between sensing if the AI numbers have fallen below the trigger number set in _AIwave, you can speed up missions or slow them down with this
"_AIMaxReinforcements",			// Defines how many AI reinforcements are available to the mission - you can change per mission difficulty to lower or raise the amount of AI overall
"_AItrigger",					// Defines how many AI trigger reinforcements - you can change per mission difficulty to lower or raise the amount of AI before reinforcements arrive
"_AIwave",						// Defines maximum amount of AI which may be deployed at once in reinforcement trigger
"_staticguns",					// Defines position of any static guns - used in a detect of "easy" mission to reduce amount of guns
"_missionObjs",					// Defines what things are being spawned as part of mission and what to clean up at the end **Don't Change**
"_crate0",						// Defines 1st crate position **Don't Change**
"_crate1",						// Defines 2nd crate position **Don't Change**
"_crate_loot_values0",			// Defines collection of weapons, items, backpacks in 1st crate **Don't Change**
"_crate_loot_values1",			// Defines collection of weapons, items, backpacks in 2nd crate **Don't Change**
"_crate_weapons0",				// Defines amount of weapons in 1st crate - you can change to adjust loot for each mission diffficulty
"_crate_weapons1",				// Defines amount of weapons in 2nd crate - you can change to adjust loot for each mission diffficulty
"_crate_items0",				// Defines amount of items in 1st crate - you can change to adjust loot for each mission diffficulty
"_crate_items1",				// Defines amount of items in 2nd crate - you can change to adjust loot for each mission diffficulty
"_crate_backpacks0",			// Defines amount of backpacks in 1st crate - you can change to adjust loot for each mission diffficulty
"_crate_backpacks1",			// Defines amount of backpacks in 2nd crate - you can change to adjust loot for each mission diffficulty
"_difficultyM",					// Defines mission difficulty result (also used for the mission marker) **Don't Change**
"_difficulty",					// Defines AI difficulty in easy mission diffficulty setting - an "easy" mission can have "hardcore" AI
"_PossibleDifficulty",			// Defines list of possible mission difficulties (isnt linked to how diffficult the AI is) - you can add more to change % chance
"_msgWIN",						// Defines mission win message - you can change to make mission win message different **Remeber there are a few versions including the pin code announce**
